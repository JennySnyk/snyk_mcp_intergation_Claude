Copy the basic configuration to your Claude configuration file:

**macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

> **Note**: Both Claude Desktop and Claude Code use the same configuration file.

```json
{

      }
    }
  }
}
```

Get your API token from: https://app.snyk.io/account

## âœ… Test Your Setup

1. **Restart Claude Desktop or reload VS Code (for Claude Code)**
2. **Open a new conversation**
3. **Ask Claude:**
   ```
   Can you check if Snyk is properly authenticated and show me the available security tools?
   ```

## ðŸ”§ Available Security Tools

Once configured, you can ask Claude to:

- **Scan for vulnerabilities:** "Scan my project for security issues"
- **Check dependencies:** "Analyze the open source dependencies in this project"
- **Review code security:** "Run a SAST scan on my Python code"
- **Audit containers:** "Check this Docker image for vulnerabilities"
- **Validate IaC:** "Review my Terraform files for security misconfigurations"

## ðŸ†˜ Need Help?

- **Authentication issues:** Run `snyk auth --check`
- **Permission errors:** Use `snyk trust /path/to/project`
- **Version issues:** Ensure Snyk CLI is v1.1298.0+
